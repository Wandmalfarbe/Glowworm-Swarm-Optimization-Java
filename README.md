# Glowworm Swarm Optimization Java

A Java implementation and visualization of the glowworm swarm optimization (GSO) algorithm invented by Krishnanand N. Kaipa and Debasish Ghose for the capturing of multiple optima of multimodal functions.

This app was created as part of a seminar work and served as an aid to understand the glowworm swarm optimization. It is a simple visualization of the glowworm movement with the target function in the background. You can choose between several target functions from the paper:

- Peaks
- Rastrigin
- Circles
- Staircase
- Plateaus
- Sky Blue
- Equal Peaks

The parameters *population size*, *iterations*, and *the initial neighborhood range* can be set in the graphical interface. Further parameters, e.g. *the initial luciferin level*, *rho* or *gamma* can easily be adjusted in the program code.

## Credits

- This Program contains code from [CircleSkinner](https://github.com/tinevez/CircleSkinner/blob/master/src/main/java/net/imagej/circleskinner/util/ColorMap.java) made by [Jean-Yves Tinevez](https://github.com/tinevez).
- The GSO Algorithm was invented by Krishnanand N. Kaipa and Debasish Ghose.

## Known Bugs

1. The new calculated position of the glowworms from the iteration *t* should be applied at iteration *t+1* and not at the same iteration (see GSOAlgorithm.java, Lines 127 and 128).
